The two code directories contain header and namelist information to compile and run channel simulations for both ROMS and MPAS-O. The input files are specified to run the 1 km simulation for both models, but these can be easily tailored to run different spatial resolutions as done in the manuscript (e.g., Table 1). This can be done by modifying parameters in `MPAS-O/namelist.ocean` and the initial file (available at the zenodo repository data archive) for `MPAS-O/streams.ocean` or by modifying the variables `Lm` and `Mm` and relevant time-stepping variables (to preserve model stability) in `ROMS/bichan_1km.in`.
